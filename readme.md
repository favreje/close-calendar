# Close Calendar

## A simple (for now) text-based representation of a monthly task list 
- Takes as input a month-end date and a task list
- Determines which day each task falls in the calendar, by mapping "workday" fields in
  the task list to actual weekdays for a given month
- Draws a landscape representation of each work week in the month (Mon - Fri)
- Populates the week-view calendar with the monthly tasks
